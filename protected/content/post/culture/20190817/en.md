Gion Matsuri Festival (祇園祭), which celebrated in Yasaka Shrine, Kyoto annually, is one of the most famous festivals in Japan. The Yasaka Shrine used red as their main color style. This sort of architectural style and color system inherit the flourishing period of the Tang Dynasty of Ancient China’s culture. That’s the reason why Kyoto is always called “little Chang’an and little Luoyang’.
This festival spends entirely whole July to celebrate in Yasaka Jinja, But the most impressive period is on the 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., July 17th. At that time, the parade team contained by 32 floats make their way along the main street of the city. Tourist can also visit it at the remnant of the July, the main parade is taken place on Yasaka Shrine, Kawaramachi, and Shijo. 

Gion Festival originated during the Heian period in the late 9th century. Because in that time, Japan suffered from a very serious plague, it is said that a ghost named minotaur was responsible for it. At that time, people built a god chair composed of 66 spears to send to the garden of god spring and prayed for the disaster to be wiped out through a street parade. However, this activity did work. That’s the derive of the Gion Matsuri. Gion Festival originated during the Heian period in the late 9th century.

This is the origin of the Gion offering, but at that time the Gion called imperial spirit will, also not nowadays' Yamaboko More close to the prototype of the modern Gion offering is the northern and southern dynasties, the folk custom is the common people s will pull the Yamaboko parade to pray for health, eliminate the bad luck. Of course, it has been handed down from generation to generation to present the unprecedented situation of the festival.

As a foreign visitor, I participate it mostly in the evening. During the festival, the city is festooned with lights and the sound of traditional percussion music fills the streets, which are filled with young men and girls in bathrobes. In the evening, the whole downtown area becomes a pedestrian street, and there are many snack shops and traditional shops for shooting guns and fishing goldfish, where you can feel the traditional Japanese style. At night, the temperature is much lower than during the day, free fans are given out at the station shops, wearing bathrobes are not too hot at that time. 

For another part of people that don’t want to stay with crowd people. They can join the 2nd procession since fewer people join it. In 2014, for the first time in almost 50 years, a second float procession was held. This second procession is known as the “Ato Matsuri,” which means “After Matsuri.” The event will now be held annually. This is a smaller procession in which only 10 of the yamaboko are pulled through the streets of downtown Kyoto. In this event, the yamaboko are pulled along a route that is the reverse of the main procession’s route. The procession starts at 9:30 a.m. and ends around 11:30 a.m.
