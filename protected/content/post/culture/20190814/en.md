# Tourism of Gifu Prefecture

Located in the middle part of Japan, away from the commercialized metropolis, Gifu Prefecture is a neglected place for most international tourists.

Gifu is conducted by Mino Province, the northern part, and Hida Province, the southern part. Although the capital of Gifu is located in Mino Province, the more interesting tourism attractions are mainly in Hida Province. Its geographical features are various, with mountains in Hida Province, plateaus in Mino Province. It has also built a friendship with the China's province our club is in, Jiangxi Province.

A few hours after departing by a Nohi bus from Nagoya, I arrived in Takayama, a main city in Hida Province. It reserves its main figure since Edo period, which brings it an alias "the tiny Kyoto of Hida". Called with "city", it is more similar to a silent town. Walking on its street without hustle and bustle in a metropolis, enjoying the cool different from other places in summer, is a relaxing activity after palatable Wagyu beef.

The first spot explored was Shirokawa village, which is renowned for its Gassho-style houses, and registered as a World Heritage. The style is built in order to survive harsh winter with heavy snowfall, and it was named by the meaning of "bring hands together, and pray to the gods" in Japanese. Once climb to a hill, you can take a shot for the harmony scene, the whole village constructed by the kawaii traditional houses. The winter light-up event holds in Shirokawa every year, amassing tourists around the world to take a photo of the warm lights breathing in the wide coverage of snow. The event is so popular that local government runs a full-reservation policy for it.

Hida Furukawa was the next destination, which is a town in Hida city. It is famous for the record-breaking animation movie *Your Name.* released in August 2016. JR Hida Furukawa station and the public library have been illustrated as background of moving scenes in the movie. Posters are common in public places, and there is a character book of *Your Name.* and a notebook in the city library allowing tourists from all latitudes to impress their footprints in Hida, and local landscapes in their minds by writing comments or drawing sketches on the notebook which can be viewed by anyone.

The cartoon figure of Hida beef has also been widespread with the explosion of *Your Name.* The beef is in the best 3 levels of quality, and the best 2 levels of yield grade of Wagyu beef. Besides the unquestionably excellent of quality, the price is really high. Having lunch with my family with hand-rolled sushi and rice made with Hida beef, our expenses broke 10,000 yen easily.

That is all the story of me, a Chinese tourist, in Gifu Prefecture. Thanks for joining us.
