The business success and won the Academy Award is a good thing. But it is 18 years old since the film was released in 2001. The animation industry is developing rapidly and not like before. And 18 years later, let's look back to this film, it is also very interesting and popular. Now, today let's talk about this classical film.

After the *Princess Mononoke*, Miyazaki decided to retire. However, after 3 years, he returned and bring his new film——*Spirited Away*. His new film had become the highest-grossing animated film in Japanese film history, and made a record that nobody can break. Also, after it released on foreign countries, it won the praise of overseas audience, too.

We can say that this is a gift for 10 years old children. The film puts the view on a 10 years old girl, and all the stories revolve around her. From straying into Yubaba's restaurant becasue she was lost her way, then finally saving her parents and go back to the real world.

Nevertheless... Is this film just so so?

If this film was sample just like that, the Academy Award is too easy to won. But in this film, also infuse Miyazaki Hayao's warning to the human and this world.

At the begining of the film, it is also the most forgettable thing——the title. In Japanese, the title of the movies is **「千と千尋の神隠し」**. And *神隠し* is a word with strong folk Japanese feature. It means "Be hidden by the god". In the past, Japanese used this word refer to the unexplained disappearance of a child or young lady who can not be found forever. Therefore, many things in film can be explained by *神隠し*. Such as the bustling street at night, Yubaba's restaurant, and greedy parents who become the pigs.

The consumer of the restaurant, some are gods, and some are monsters. Afte Sen help are consumer who is huge and everyone do not like him cleaned up the trash in his stomach, she found that this consumer is god of the river. Also, it is ironic reference to environmental polluation at the same time.

At the end of the film, the appearance of the Kaonashi is another irony to Japan at that time. The Kaonashi threw the gold to all the people, who only paid attention to the gold on the ground. The scene was chaotic.But when Kaonashi only gave the gold to Sen, Sen did not accept the gift of Kaonashi and ran away. when the Yubaba command people get more gold from the man without face, but the gold in the Yubaba underground into mud.This event corresponds to Japan's bubble economy, where a boom turns to dust; People are intoxicated with prosperity, but only people like Sen are sober. However, such people are only a few.

At the end of the movie, when the Haku and Sen are separated, the Haku tells Sen that he can't go back because the river he lives in has been destroyed by human. When Sen asked Haku: will we meet again? Haku answers: Of course!

In fact, some audiences already know, Sen and Haku meet again just a joke, is the gentle Haku to Sen. Human damage to nature, destroy the original ecological environment to build buildings, roads and so on. All of these can not be restored, if Sen want to see the Haku again, then human must stop all the damage to the environment.

> Behind the prosperity, there must be a corresponding price.

We should think about the destruction of the environment for the immediate benefit. Is this a meaningful thing?
