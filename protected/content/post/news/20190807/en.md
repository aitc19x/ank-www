On August 7, 2019, the official website of CNK has been established formally.

First of all, we would convey our sincere appreciation to members of the development team, and all third-party resources we used on this site.

Established in 2019, it is a new but lively club. With new students coming to our school, we hold recruitment-related activities every September, welcome to join us.

Except from participating in person offline, the new website would also update the latest news on time.

Our website are mainly conducted by 5 sections: "News", "Culture", "On demand", "Live", and "TV". Through the "News" section, you can get the latest news about and around us, and recruitment-related information would be published there. The "Culture" section records members' ideas and feeling about Japan. Furthermore, totally free online courses are provided in the "On demand" and "Live" sections. The "TV" section can help you experience the exotic Japanese culture by watching Japanese TV.

All basic information of our club is mentioned above.
